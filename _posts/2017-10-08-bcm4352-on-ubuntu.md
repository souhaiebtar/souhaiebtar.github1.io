# History :
like nothing perfect in life,  i have a lenovo y510p, 2 years ago i tried to install OSX on it, generally the install went well (i grapped an iso, containing yosemite, from rutracker and i putted it into a usb drive and voila, but you can create your own and it's what i advise to people) but to make all things work properly (near perfect) you have to read and try a lot ( on desktop is lot easier ), for my case i had a lot of help thinks to [this topic](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/303276-guide-for-installing-os-x-on-lenovo-ideapad-y510p/), by the way thinks to the one that created it and every one that participated and commented, one of things that i have done is to replace my intel wifi+bl card by a broadcom card (branded under the name DELL DW 1550), i changed some value on my IO80211Family.kext file ([thanks to this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4bnQ_uW4a4) and added some kext) and i had wifi and bluetooth working (this after using ethernet cable where ever i go for 1 year), recently i wanted to install linux on it, and this is when problem start to popup,

it appear that broadcom card are the worst one it come to linux, the driver is a mess and nothing is straighforward,

# Install wifi
to resume after reading a lot, those are the steps you can use to make your bcm 4352 wifi+bl (you can try of other bcm card),

1. sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source
2. open /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add those line to the end of the file
```
        blacklist b43
		    blacklist ssb
		    blacklist brcmfmac
		    blacklist brcmsmac
		    blacklist bcma
```
3. save the file
4. sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl brcmfmac brcmsmac bcma
5. sudo modprobe wl

now, when you open the network manager you should have you wifi working (step 4,5 can be skipped by rebooting your machine, they allow unload module(4) and load module(5) to the kernel)

# Install bluetooth
installing bluetooth was not easy as it was for wifi, after a lot of search i stumbled upon [a cool Github repo](https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware) that contain every thing that you need, for installing bluetooth we are gone use file extracted from windows drivers (yeah little history, years ago to make wifi work on linux, the way to go to load windows drivers, with little change ),
the important step for bluetooth, is to get the name of your wifi+bl card correctly, in my case i used ```lsusb``` to get the vendor/model id or ```lspci``` to get the name of your card, after that open [the repo](https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware0) and open the file *DEVICES.md* search in the file for the name of your card (in the column Device name or using the result of ```lsusb``` and the column Device ID) after finding a match note the *Firmware file* name and go to [brcm folder of the repo](https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware/tree/master/brcm), download the .hcd file which correspond to your Firmware file name and download it

the file should have been downloaded to your Downloads folder,
go to the folder, using terminal for example and type
```sudo mv *.hcd /lib/firmware/brcm```
now bluetooth should work if it doesn't, give it a reboot,
hope i have helped
